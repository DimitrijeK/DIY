## Arduino Projects 

  This repository have all open source file for interacting and connecting various different sensors to Arduino. This is something that I am really passionate about and I really like to experiment with hardware, and especially Arduino. It is pretty straigh-forward on how to use these files and run the project your-self. Here are few steps to follow in order to make your interaction with these sensors even more friendly.

1. First step would be to download software called [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) so you can write your code in it and load it onto your Arduino
2. Once you have downloaded and installed your IDE you are pretty much ready to code
3. You also have to make sure you had the right USB to connect it to your Arduino and PC/Laptop
4. Once you have finished writing you program, you can hit the arrow in the top left corner and upload the code to your micro-controller (make sure you choose the right Micro-controller,Processor and Port in Tools)
5. You can also download any code you see here use it in your IDE
