# Arduino Nano with Distance Sensor and LED Diode :wrench:

Did this project for fun and to learn how arduino and other hardware components work.
Attached distance sensor to the breadboard and made LED flash based on what distance the object
in front is. If it is really close it will flash red then orange and green if it is not close at all.

Hardware Components Needed:

	-Arduino Nano (and Micro USB)
	-HC-SR04 Sensor
	-RGB LED Diode
		*the one I used is common cathode,
		but you can also use common anode
	-Breadboard
	-10 jumper cables
	-3 resistors (I used 2-100ohm and 1-220ohm)

Software needed:

	-Arduino IDE
